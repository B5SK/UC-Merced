The General Idea of the use of Index is that it must be used only for finding data and not to be included when doing any queries other than finding data, such as copying data from table to table with index. The reason the included index takes so long is that it tags along with the query processes as it also needs to be either updated or modified for the sake of its function. A good example is the copying of the tables from Exercise 3. 

The difference between the lab3 queries with index and the lab3 queries without the index is that the queries with the index is much faster due to the fact that it does not search the entire table. However there are some errors in my queries or efficiency issues because despite having index and as well as not having it, it took a very long time to finish.
