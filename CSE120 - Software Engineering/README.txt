This was a project for Software Engineering and created an Android App

My biggest contribution of the project was brainstorming the prototype as well as additional features that we may add.
I also did some designing and coding in the main Android App.

The main lesson that I learned from this is that it is very difficult to be on the same page. Everyone had unique and
exciting ideas but it was difficult to condense them into one uniform idea. Most importantly, we needed someone to bring
everyone together to succeed in the project.
