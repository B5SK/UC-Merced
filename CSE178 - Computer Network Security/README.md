The only programming project was this lab.
<br>
In this lab,  we had to create a AES encryption of the 128-bit PlainText and 128-bit key and revert it back to its original plaintext by the ordering
of the AES-16 bit encryption.
<br>
The most difficult concept to understand was the MixColumns section of the encryption stage.
